Hi! My Name is Tom Staley

I have a passion for all things relating to computers, programming especially. I have experience in a wide range of programming languages, including Python and CSS, and I have also taken several computer networking courses at Leamington College. In 2023, I took part in the Princes Trust Team Program, also at Leamington College, which helped me to improve my teambuilding and employability skills. 

My dream job is, of course, game development. My interest in computers originated with my interest in games, and while I don't have as much time to play them anymore, I'm still fascinated by how they're made and how they work. In my free time I often consider what a game I'd make would look like, and how it would work. This has been the driving force behind my experience in computing and programming.
